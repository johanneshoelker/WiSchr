	abstract = {In this paper, an inexpensive, a lightweight and easily controlled robotic arm with human interface is developed. The developed robotic arm is fully functional and accurately reacts to the movements from the user. The human user wears 2 accelerometers on his/her arm. These accelerometers relay both position and speed vector information to the robotic arm. The user also wears a glove that controls the flex sensor which gives readings to the claw. The robotic arm is on a fully mobile base that moves the arm from location to location in any given room. The research methodology and design are introduced before the robot system is realized and tested. Finally, conclusions are given and future improvements are discussed.},

In this article, open source design (OSD) is presented as a potential concept leading towards alternative and eco-efﬁcient production and consumption patterns. Potential advantages of OSD for environmental sustainability are hypothesized and confronted with the analysis of the environmental friendliness of four open source products. Two synergies between sustainable design and OSD are identiﬁed (product modularity and design for local manufacturing) as well as corresponding challenges for further research.},

	abstract = {Tele-operation systems have been developed to perform tasks in extreme environments that cannot be accessed easily by humans. However, non-intuitive control interfaces, low immersive feeling, and wireless communication issues have prevented the wide application of such tele-operation systems. In this study, an intuitive and interactive control interface using inertial measurement units (IMUs), a wearable sensing glove, and a head-mounted display (HMD) is proposed to control a tele-operated robot in a remote place. Using user information measured from the wearable interface, the desired joint angles of the robot are derived by a kinematic analysis of the robot. Also, the measured visual information and the torque of the robot hand are transmitted to the user as visual feedback on the HMD and vibrational feedback to the user’s ﬁngertips, respectively. A semi-autonomous control strategy, referred to as shared control, was developed to overcome dimensional differences between the user and the robot, and to reduce the user’s workload. As telecommunication methods, a longterm evolution (LTE) and a virtual private network (VPN) are used. The performance of the proposed system was veriﬁed by experiments.},

	abstract = {Robot control is a key competence for robot manufacturers and a lot of development is made to increase robot performance, reduce robot cost and introduce new functionalities. Examples of development areas that get big attention today are multi robot control, safe control, force control, 3D vision, remote robot supervision and wireless communication. The application beneﬁts from these developments are discussed as well as the technical challenges that the robot manufacturers meet. Model-based control is now a key technology for the control of industrial robots and models and control schemes are continuously reﬁned to meet the requirements on higher performance even when the cost pressure leads to the design of robot mechanics that is more difﬁcult to control. Driving forces for the future development of robots can be found in, for example, new robot applications in the automotive industry, especially for the ﬁnal assembly, in small and medium size enterprises, in foundries, in food industry and in the processing and assembly of large structures. Some scenarios on future robot control development are proposed. One scenario is that lightweight robot concepts could have an impact on future car manufacturing and on future automation of small and medium size enterprises (SMEs). Such a development could result in modular robots and in control schemes using sensors in the robot arm structure, sensors that could also be used for the implementation of redundant safe control. Introducing highly modular robots will increase the need of robot installation support, making Plug and Play functionality even more important. One possibility to obtain a highly modular robot program could be to use a recently developed new type of parallel kinematic robot structure with large work space in relation to the robot foot print. For further efﬁcient use of robots, the scenario of adaptive robot performance is introduced. This means that the robot control is optimised with respect to the thermal and fatigue load on the robot for the speciﬁc program that the robot performs. The main conclusion of the presentation is that industrial robot development is far away from its limits and that a lot of research and development is needed to obtain a more widely use of robot automation in industry.},

It provides an intuitive way of teaching a complicated humanoid robot arm to perform human-like behaviors. In this paper, we build an interactive imitation system composed of Kinect and a self-built humanoid robot arm, which could mimic human upper limb motions in real time. The Kinect device captures the positions and joint orientations of the participant’s upper limb. A method of determining the credibility of estimated joints is put forward, and along with Savitzky-Golay smoothing filter, we decrease jitter caused by measurement errors of Kinect. Experiments indicate that the robot arm system has a certain flexibility to accomplish a variety of human upper limb motions.},

Thus, the inverse kinematics of an human arm has a nonunique solution. Resolving this redundancy becomes critical as the human interacts with a wearable robot and the inverse kinematics solution of these two coupled systems must be identical to guarantee an seamless integration. The redundancy of the arm can be formulated by deﬁning the swivel angle, the rotation angle of the plane deﬁned by the upper and lower arm around a virtual axis that connects the shoulder and wrist joints. Analyzing reaching tasks recorded with a motion capture system indicates that the swivel angle is selected such that when the elbow joint is ﬂexed, the palm points to the head. Based on these experimental results, a new criterion is formed to resolve the human arm redundancy. This criterion was implemented into the control algorithm of an upper limb 7-DOF wearable robot. Experimental results indicate that by using the proposed redundancy resolution criterion, the error between the predicted and the actual swivel angle adopted by the motor control system is less then 5◦.},

	abstract = {In this study, we propose a multi-GPU-based 8KVR stitching system that operates in real time on both local and cloud machine environments. The proposed system first obtains multiple 4 K video inputs, decodes them, and generates a stitched 8KVR video stream in real time. The generated 8KVR video stream can be downloaded and rendered omnidirectionally in player apps on smartphones, tablets, and head-mounted displays. To speed up processing, we adopt group-of-pictures-based distributed decoding/encoding and buffering with the NV12 format, along with multi-GPU-based parallel processing. Furthermore, we develop several algorithms such as equirectangular projection-based color correction, real-time CG overlay, and object motion-based seam estimation and correction, to improve the stitching quality. From experiments in both local and cloud machine environments, we confirm the feasibility of the proposed 8KVR stitching system with stitching speed of up to 83.7 fps for six-channel and 62.7 fps for eight-channel inputs. In addition, in an 8KVR live streaming test on the 5G MEC/cloud, the proposed system achieves stable performances with 8 K@30 fps in both indoor and outdoor environments, even during motion.},

            A symbolic notation devised by Reuleaux to describe mechanisms did not recognize the necessary number of variables needed for complete description. A reconsideration of the problem leads to a symbolic notation which permits the complete description of the kinematic properties of all lower-pair mechanisms by means of equations. The symbolic notation also yields a method for studying lower-pair mechanisms by means of matrix algebra; two examples of application to space mechanisms are given.},
